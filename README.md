Every time you receive or spend gold - the addon writes this to the log.
The log is reset if you restart the interface, but you can enable logging in the add-on settings.
Also, the addon maintains statistics of income by day keeping the last 60 days.

The addon has quite flexible settings. Thanks to this, you can configure: The stack of recent transactions, saving transactions, the minimum income in a transaction for writing, and so on.
